                        <em>Mutator</em> is a multi-sequencing effector Max for Live device developed in <strong>Max/MSP</strong>. It treats audio processing as something rhythmic and interactive, rather than a static insert on a channel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It features six audio effects in sequential order: pitch shifter, beat repeat, flanger, phaser, downsampler, and Schroeder reverb, each implemented as compact DSP patches designed for clarity and performance reliability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The device's core is its sequencer, which triggers each effect's on/off state. It automatically syncs its step count to Ableton's time signature. You can set the step length (1/4, 1/8, 1/16) with dotted or triplet rhythms over one- or two-bar cycles. Each effect has one main parameter (scaled 0-100) for easy control, plus a global dry/wet mix. The UI also features a dynamic color palette that selects from 12 presets on load.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the developer, I built all components from scratch except for the downsampler, which is adapted from a Cycling ’74 tutorial patch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project reflects my broader interest in building responsive musical tools: systems that combine DSP with interaction design to give performers new ways of shaping sound, improvising with structure, and engaging with real-time control.
