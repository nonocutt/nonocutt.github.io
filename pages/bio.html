<h2>About Noah Wang</h2>

<p><b>Noah Wang</b> is a multifaceted composer, producer, sound artist, programmer, and pianist who crafts experimental art for those with a taste for the unconventional. Their work invites curious minds to explore the realms of the weird and extraordinary.</p>
<p>Noah’s musical journey began in the classical world as a pianist and composer. In 2023, they were admitted to Berklee College of Music with a scholarship, where their creative world expanded rapidly. There, they immersed themselves in jazz and electronic genres such as techno, IDM, and drum and bass, which opened the door to a more curious and experimental approach to music-making. This phase marked a shift toward blurring the boundaries between structured composition and improvisation, digital and analog, human and machine.</p>
<p>Since then, Noah has taken a deep dive into the technical side of music. Their interests include music computing, modular synthesis, and avant-garde composition, all of which inform their hybrid creative practice. As both a developer and performer, Noah bridges the technical and expressive aspects of creative work. They’ve built creative tools such as a Python-based synthesizer and a retro-style pinball game. Their performance background spans jazz piano concerts, studio sessions, DJ sets, and live electronic acts. Their work includes a series of electronic singles, including <i>Tunneling Transcendence</i>, <i>Sensitive Margin</i>, and <i>Angelic Ascension</i>.<p>
<p>Currently, Noah is pursuing a double major in Jazz Composition and Electronic Production & Design, along with a dual minor in Creative Coding and Electronic Performance at Berklee. They are expected to graduate in December 2025. In April 2025, they received the Thelonious Monk Award and the Richard Devine Sound Design Award from the respective departments, in recognition of their interdisciplinary excellence. Noah’s practice continues to evolve at the intersection of sound, code, and storytelling, grounded in experimentation and a deep commitment to making art that resonates emotionally and intellectually.</p>
